:sparkles::rocket: **Clipboard is the power tool that saves you time and effort.** üèñÔ∏èüå¥

Before, you've always had to think about where exactly you want to move things, which multiplied your mental workload and made many scenarios totally impractical. 

Now, have a _powerful_ clipboard to use **anywhere in the terminal**, just like a GUI!

- **`Easy.`** Friendly to newbies and power users.
- **`Breezy.`** Zero configuration needed to use.
- **`Beautiful.`** Breaks the rules to look pretty.
- **`Unified.`** Functions exactly the same everywhere.
- **`Compatible.`** Works on anything that supports C++20.
- **`Scriptable.`** Embed it right into your own programs.
- **`Universal.`** Supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish.
- **`Integrated.`** Connects with [many native GUI clipboards.](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/wiki/GUI-Clipboard-Compat)
- **`Tiny.`** Mere tens of kilobytes in size.
- **`FOSS.`** 100% free and open-source.

---

**Show Contents** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]show|[-]sh)[(num)|_(id)]`

![Simple Configuration](documentation/readme-assets/CBSimpleConfiguration.png)

### **Environment Variables**

**`CI`** &emsp; Set this to anything to make Clipboard overwrite existing items without a user prompt when pasting. This variable is intended for Continuous Integration scripts where a live human is not present to make decisions.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_TMPDIR`** &emsp; Set this to the directory that only Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a temporary directory.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_PERSISTDIR`** &emsp; Set this to the directory that only Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a persistent directory.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_ALWAYS_PERSIST`** &emsp; Set this to anything to make Clipboard always use persistent clipboards.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_NOGUI`** &emsp; Set this to anything to disable integration with GUI clipboards.

---

**`FORCE_COLOR`** &emsp; Set this to anything to make Clipboard always show color regardless of what you set `NO_COLOR` to.

---

**`NO_COLOR`** &emsp; Set this to anything to make Clipboard not show any colors.

</details>

---

### **Flags**

**`--clipboard (clipboard)`, `-c (clipboard)`** &emsp; Add this to choose which clipboard you want to use.

---

**`--fast-copy`, `-fc`** &emsp; Add this to use links when copying, cutting, or pasting. If you modify the items that you used with this flag, then the items you paste will have the same changes.
