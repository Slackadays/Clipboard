# ðŸ“‹ Clipboard 
Cut, copy, and paste absolutely anything anywhere you want, all from the comfort of your terminal! This is the ultimate clipboard system for the command line.

**Clipboard...**
- **is really tiny**. We're serious about code size; Clipboard rings in at mere kilobytes on most platforms.
- **is really simple**. We're serious about scope; Clipboard is exactly that, a clipboard.
- **is really friendly**. We're serious about UX; Clipboard is zero-config and is carefully designed to be friendly to newbies and power users alike.
- **is really global**. We're serious about localization; Clipboard currently supports English, Spanish, and Portuguese locales.
- **"just works" everywhere**. We're serious about compatibility; Clipboard works on any Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or OpenIndiana system, or anything that supports C++20, all with ZERO dependencies.
- **looks pretty**. We're serious about design; Clipboard has colorful text baked in everywhere.** ðŸŒˆ Say adiÃ³s to boring black & white!
- **saves time**. We're serious about productivity; Clipboard frees you from ugly, temporary directories and memorizing file locations!

**You can disable colors with the NO_COLOR environment variable.

# 1 - How To Use

In all commands, you can substitute `cb` for `clipboard`. 
Add a number from 0 to 9 to the end of the action to choose which clipboard you want to use (the default is 0). 
That's right, you have 10 different clipboards!

## Copy
`clipboard copy (file) [files]`

Examples:

```
cb copy foo.txt launchcodes.doc
clipboard copy1 MyDirectory
cb copy8 bar.conf AnotherDirectory baz.txt
```
## Cut
`clipboard cut (file) [files]`

Examples:

```
cb cut bar.txt baz.docx
clipboard cut5 MyDirectory
cb cut9 bar.conf AnotherDirectory baz.txt
```
## Paste
`clipboard paste`

## Pipe In

`(something) | clipboard [copy]`

## Pipe Out

`clipboard [paste] | (something)`

or

`clipboard [paste] > (some file)`

## Show Contents
`clipboard show`

## Clear
`clipboard clear`
