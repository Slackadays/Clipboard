<br>

<i>I started using this because <b>I just wanted an easy "cb copy && cb paste"</b> VS trying to remember the correct input AND output flags when Im using xclip with different file types. I write a lot of shell scripts that copy certain stuff like images and text and <b>this makes it a lot easier.</b></i>

  <img alt="Get it from the Snap Store" src="https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg" align="right"/>
</a>

<br>

**Void Linux**
```sh
sudo xbps-install -S Clipboard
```

<br>

**GitHub Downloads**

First, get the latest revision of the Clipboard Project [from GitHub Actions](https://nightly.link/Slackadays/Clipboard/workflows/build-clipboard/main) or the latest release [from GitHub Releases.](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/releases/latest)

Then, unpack what you just downloaded to a nice place anywhere on your system.

If you downloaded the Flatpak, now do `flatpak install what-you-downloaded.flatpak`. Or if you downloaded the Snap, now do `sudo snap install --dangerous what_you_downloaded.snap`.

Finally, add CB to your PATH (so that you can run it anywhere) by doing one of the following:

```sh
# For all platforms except Windows, Flatpak, and Snap
$ export PATH=$PATH:/where/you/unpacked/cb
# Add this to your terminal startup file like .bashrc or the equivalent so that it works every time.
# To get the current path (in case you don't know it), do the "pwd" command.

# For Flatpak
$ alias cb='flatpak run app.getclipboard.Clipboard'
# Add this to your terminal startup file like .bashrc or the equivalent so that it works every time.

# For Snap
$ alias cb='snap run clipboard'
# Add this to your terminal startup file like .bashrc or the equivalent so that it works every time.

# For Windows PowerShell
> $Env:PATH += ";C:\where\you\unpacked\cb"
# Add this to your PowerShell profile (which is located in $profile) so that this works every time.
# To get the current path (in case you don't know it), do the "Get-Location" command.
```

<br>
<br>

### <img src="documentation/readme-assets/InstallManually.png" alt="Install Manually" height=25px />
You'll need CMake, C++20 support, and OpenSSL, and if you want X11 or Wayland support, you'll also need libx11 or libwayland plus Wayland Protocols respectively. If you're on Linux, you'll need ALSA.

Get the latest release instead of the latest commit by adding `--branch 0.9.1` right after `git clone...`.

Change the system installation prefix by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/custom/prefix` to `cmake ..`, or the library install location by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/custom/dir`.
```bash
# First, let's download the code and go a nice place to build everything.
$ git clone https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard 
$ cd Clipboard/build

# Now let's set up CMake and build CB.
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ cmake --build . -j 12

# Finally, let's install it onto our system.
$ cmake --install .
```

### <img src="documentation/readme-assets/Uninstall.png" alt="Uninstall" height=25px />

Remove everything listed in `install_manifest.txt`. If you're not using Windows, you can also do `xargs rm < install_manifest.txt`.

<br>

### ![How To Use](documentation/readme-assets/CBHowToUse.png)

### <img src="documentation/readme-assets/Examples.png" alt="Examples" height=25px />

```sh
# Let's start by copying a file.
$ cb copy NuclearLaunchCodes.pdf

# Now, let's paste this file.
$ cb paste

# Not bad, right?

# Let's make a note for this clipboard.
$ cb note "Keep this a secret"

# What if you wanted to pipe the note in?
$ echo "Keep this a secret OR ELSE" | cb note

# Now let's cut a directory to a different clipboard.
$ cb cut69 MyDirectory

# We put the 69 right after "cut" to tell CB to put MyDirectory in clipboard 69.

# Let's add a file to this same clipboard.
$ cb add69 SomeFile

# To remove a file, enter its name to remove just that file.
$ cb remove69 SomeFile

# Alternatively, you can put in a regex pattern instead to generalize the removal.
$ cb remove69 "So.*le"

# Finally, let's paste what we have in clipboard 69.
$ cb paste69

# You can copy multiple files at the same time. 
# Let's try the "_420" persistent clipboard for this one.
$ cb copy_420 foo.bar NotAVirus.bar.mp3.exe

# Like before, we can remove anything with a regex patttern.
$ cb remove_420 "*.mp3\.exe"

# Notes work exactly the same way for every clipboard.
$ cb note_420 "Some kosher content here"

# Let's look at everything we've stored in clipboard _420.
$ cb show_420

# Now let's see our original note and then clear that clipboard. 
$ cb note
$ cb clear

# This is the same as "cb note" but for clipboard "_420" again.
$ cb note_420

# Let's shake things up. Say you have some kind of content you want to ignore.
# This content could be anything from a password to raw binary data.
# To ignore certain kinds of content, use a regex pattern of your choice.

# Let's try this with a classic example.
$ cb ignore "H.*2"

# This pattern will ignore anything starting with "H" and ending with "2."

# Now, this next command will fail because CB will ignore the content in it through the pattern.
$ cb copy "Hunter2"

# Let's get some more detailed information about our clipboards.
$ cb info
$ cb info69
$ cb info_420

# To wrap things up, let's get a bird's eye view of everything so far.
$ cb
# Doing "cb" is the exact same as "cb status."
$ cb status

# These are just a handful of examples. 
# Check the documentation below for tons more examples of all the commands!
```

<br>

### <img src="documentation/readme-assets/TheBasics.png" alt="The Basics" height=25px />

Add a number to the end of your action to choose which temporary clipboard you want to use (the default is 0). Or, add `_` to use a persistent clipboard instead.

<details><summary> &ensp; <b>Copy</b> &emsp; <code>cb [--](copy|cp)[(num)|_(id)] (file) [files]</code> or <code>(something) | cb [[--](copy|cp)][(num)|_(id)]</code></summary>

<br>

Copy a file.
```sh
$ cb copy FooFile
$ cb --copy FooFile
$ cb cp FooFile 
$ cb --cp FooFile
# These are the same!
```

Copy a file and a directory.
```sh
$ cb copy FooFile BarDir
# These are also the same!
```

Copy piped in data.
```sh
$ echo "Foobar" | cb
$ echo "Foobar" | cb copy 
# The "copy" action is optional here since the only possible action here in the first place is "copy"
```

Copy text directly.
```sh
$ cb copy "Aventura was the best bachata band"
```
Note: This happens instead of copying a file/directory if there is only one item present and that item doesn't exist as a file/directory.

Copy a file to the clipboard named "4"
```sh
$ cb copy4 FooFile
```

Copy piped in data to the persistent clipboard named "hello"
```sh
$ echo "Foobar" | cb copy_hello
```

Copy text to the clipboard named "hey"
```sh
$ cb --clipboard hey copy "Aventura was the best bachata band"
$ cb -c hey copy "Aventura was the best bachata band" 
# These are the same!
```

Copy a file with spaces and many directories to clipboard "50" using the abbreviated action name.
```sh
$ cb cp50 "Aventura/God's Project/04 Un Chi Chi.flac" BarDir BazDir
```

</details>

<br>

<details><summary> &ensp; <b>Cut</b> &emsp; <code>cb [--](cut|ct)[(num)|_(id)] (file) [files]</code> or <code>(something) | cb [[--](cut|ct)][(num)|_(id)]</code></summary>

<br>

Cut a file.
```sh
$ cb cut FooFile
$ cb --cut FooFile
$ cb ct FooFile 
$ cb --ct FooFile
# These are the same!
```

Cut a file and a directory.
```sh
$ cb cut FooFile BarDir
# These are also the same!
```

Cut piped in data.
```sh
$ echo "Foobar" | cb cut
```
Note: Cutting piped in data is the same as copying, except that CB will delete all content after you paste it somewhere.

Cut text directly.
```sh
$ cb cut "Hunter2"
```
Note: This happens instead of cutting a file/directory if there is only one item present and that item doesn't exist as a file/directory.

Cut a file to the clipboard named "4"
```sh
$ cb cut4 FooFile
```

Cut piped in data to the persistent clipboard named "hello"
```sh
$ echo "Foobar" | cb cut_hello
```

Cut text to the clipboard named "hey"
```sh
$ cb --clipboard hey cut "Aventura was the best bachata band"
$ cb -c hey cut "Aventura was the best bachata band"
# These are the same!
```

Cut a file with spaces and many directories to clipboard "50" using the abbreviated action name.
```sh
$ cb ct50 "Aventura/God's Project/04 Un Chi Chi.flac" BarDir BazDir
```

</details>

<br>

<details><summary> &ensp; <b>Paste</b> &emsp; <code>cb [--](paste|p)[(num)|_(id)] [regex] [regexes]</code> or <code>cb [[--](paste|p][(num)|_(id)] | (something)</code> or <code>cb [[--](paste|p)][(num)|_(id)] > (some file)</code></summary>

<br>

Start by copying or cutting something.
```sh
$ cb copy FooFile WhyAventuraIsTheBest.pdf
```

Paste in the current working directory.
```sh
$ cb paste
$ cb --paste
$ cb p
$ cb --p
# These are the same!
```
Note: If you paste after cutting, then CB will delete the original files that you cut.

Paste anything containing "Aventura."

```sh
$ cb p ".*Aventura.*"
```

Now, let's copy some raw data.
```sh
$ echo "Bananas!" | cb
```

Paste the raw data file in the current working directory.
```sh
$ cb paste
# Also the same
```

Pipe everything out to some file.
```sh
$ cb paste > SomeFile
```

Pipe everything from clipboard "42" out to some file.
```sh
$ cb paste42 > SomeFile
$ cb p42 > SomeFile
$ cb -c 42 > SomeFile 
# These three versions all work great!
```

Pipe everything out to some program.
```sh
$ cb | cat
# These three versions also all work great.
$ cb | Write-Output 
# The version for PowerShell
```

Pipe everything from persistent clipboard "2" out to some program.
```sh
$ cb paste_2 | cat
$ cb p_2 | cat
$ cb -c _2 | cat 
# These three versions also all work great.
$ cb -c _2 | Write-Output 
# The version for PowerShell
```

Note: If you paste after cutting, then CB will delete the raw data afterwards, effectively only letting you paste once.

</details>

<br>

<details><summary> &ensp; <b>Add Contents</b> &emsp; <code>cb [--](add|ad)[(num)|_(id)] (file|text) [files]</code> or <code>(something) | cb [[--](add|ad)][(num)|_(id)]</code></summary>

# CB now holds FooFile and SomeOtherFile
```

Add a directory.
```sh
$ cb add "We Broke The Rules"
```

Now let's copy some raw data.
```sh
$ cb copy "'Let me find that'"
```

Add raw data to the end of what's stored.
```sh
$ cb add " is one of Romeo Santos' catchphrases."
# The content is now: 'Let me find that' is one of Romeo Santos' catchphrases.
```

Add raw data by piping it in.
```sh
$ echo " What's yours?" | cb add 
# The content is now: 'Let me find that' is one of Romeo Santos' catchphrases. What's yours?
```

</details>

<br>

$ cb --rm "B.*"
# CB will match this against "BarDir" and "BazDir" and remove them
```

Remove everything matching a specific name
```sh
$ cb remove "BarDir"
# CB will match this against "BarDir" only and remove it
```

Now let's copy some raw data.
```sh
$ cb copy "A bachatero is someone who makes bachata music."
```

Remove anything with a space beforehand and that ends with "-ero"
```sh
$ cb remove "(?<= ).*ero"
# The content is now: A  is someone who makes bachata music.
```

Remove anything matching "music" by piping the pattern in.
```sh
$ echo "music" | cb remove

Note: If you don't provide a destination clipboard, then the Load action will load the contents into the default clipboard.

Load the contents of some clipboard into the default.

```sh
$ cb load_foo
```

Note: This is useful if you want to load content into GUI clipboard systems, as they only connect to the default clipboard.

</details>

<br>

<details><summary> &ensp; <b>Swap Contents</b> &emsp; <code>cb [--](swap|sw)[(num)|_(id)] [clipboard]</code></summary>

<br>

Start by copying something to two clipboards.

$ cb swap 2
$ cb --swap 2
$ cb sw 2
$ cb --sw 2
# All work great!

$ cb swap2
$ cb --swap2
$ cb sw2
$ cb --sw2
# Since swapping is commutative, the target can be freely swapped with the destination.
```

Note: If you don't provide a destination clipboard, then the Swap action will swap the contents into the default clipboard.

</details>

<br>

<details><summary> &ensp; <b>Import Clipboards</b> &emsp; <code>cb [--](import|imp) [source folder]</code></summary>

### <img src="documentation/readme-assets/TipsAndTricks.png" alt="Tips And Tricks" height=25px />

Need to paste a funky symbol somewhere a lot? Copy it to a persistent clipboard.
```sh
$ cb cp_theta Î¸
$ cb -c amog cp à¶ž
```

Paste whatever's in the clipboard straight into your favorite text editor.
```sh
# Vim
:r !cb
# Nano
[Ctrl-T] cb
# VSCode
cb | code -
```

Copy a password securely by deleting it once you've pasted it.
```sh
$ cb cut "AVeryStrongPassword!"
$ cb | some-program
# Now gone
```

On a slow system? Cache certain things so you don't have to do them again.
```sh
$ neofetch | cb cp_neo
$ cb | cat
```
    
Yank anything sitting in your terminal without ever touching the mouse.
```sh
$ env | yank -d = -- cb
```
    
Instantly copy to the main clipboard using your favorite dmenu tool.
```sh
$ cb cp "$(cb st | jq -r '.[] | if type=="array" then .[].path else if type=="object" then .path else . end end' | dmenu)"
# For copying the latest entry from any of your clipboards
$ cb cp "$(cb hs | jq -r '.[].content | if type=="array" then .[].path else if type=="object" then .path else . end end' | dmenu)"
# For copying any entry from a specific clipboard
```

Need to share or pore over log files? Copy them in one step!
```sh
$ journalctl | cb
# For systemd
$ sudo dmesg | cb
# For Linux; note that you're not running "sudo cb" here
$ cb copy logs/latest.log
# For Minecraft servers
```

Want CB to look different? Change up the color scheme.
```sh
# This one looks like The Matrix
$ export CLIPBOARD_THEME=green
$ cb
# This one is for light backgrounds
$ export CLIPBOARD_THEME=light
$ cb
# Check out the other themes too!
```

Here's what some of these themes might look like.

Make your own scripts that can fully automate your workflows.
```sh
#!/bin/sh
# This script does nothing except serve as an example of automating CB.
link="https://SomeWebsiteWithLotsOfContent"
wget link
cb copy *.jpg *.png
cb remove "AZ.*\.png"
cb | tar -cf foobar.tar
cb -c footar < foobar.tar
cb note "Latest files from website ABCXYZ"
```

<br>

Start from a blank slate.

$ cb -c SomeCB copy "A really really long sentence, and I mean really realy super DUPER long!"
```

Note: Although copying to a temporary clipboard that doesn't start with a number is impossible using the conventional method of adding it to the end of the action, this alternative method is completely supported and works great.

Choose a persistent clipboard.

<br>

`CLIPBOARD_HISTORY` supports up to 2^32 - 1 as a value. So, go ahead. Crank that b*tch up to a billion.
```sh
$ export CLIPBOARD_HISTORY=1000000000

```sh
$ export CLIPBOARD_TMPDIR=/home/jackson/SomeDirectory
$ cb copy *
> $Env:CLIPBOARD_TMPDIR = /home/jackson/SomeDirectory
