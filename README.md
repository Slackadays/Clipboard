![Simple Configuration](documentation/readme-banners/CBSimpleConfiguration.png)

---

**`CI`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to make Clipboard overwrite existing items without a user prompt when pasting. This variable is intended for Continuous Integration scripts where a live human is not present to make decisions.

---

**`FORCE_COLOR`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to make Clipboard always show color regardless of what you set `NO_COLOR` to.

---

**`TMPDIR`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to the directory that Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a temporary directory. Other programs use `TMPDIR` as well, so be careful about changing this.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_TMPDIR`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to the directory that only Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a temporary directory.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_PERSISTDIR`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to the directory that only Clipboard will use to hold the items you cut or copy into a persistent directory.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_ALWAYS_PERSIST`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to make Clipboard always use persistent clipboards.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_NOGUI`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to disable integration with GUI clipboards.

---

**`NO_COLOR`** &emsp; Set this environment variable to make Clipboard not show any colors.

---

**`--fast-copy`, `-fc`** &emsp; Add this flag to use links when copying, cutting, or pasting. If you modify the items that you used with this flag, then the items you paste will have the same changes.
