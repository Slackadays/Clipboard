:sparkles::rocket: **Clipboard is the power tool that saves you time and effort.** üèñÔ∏èüå¥

Before, you've always had to think about where exactly you want to move things, which multiplied your mental workload and made many scenarios totally impractical. 

Now, have a _powerful_ clipboard to use **anywhere in the terminal**, just like a GUI!

- **`Easy.`** Friendly to newbies and power users.
- **`Breezy.`** Zero configuration needed to use.
- **`Beautiful.`** Breaks the rules to look pretty.
- **`Unified.`** Functions exactly the same everywhere.
- **`Compatible.`** Works on anything that supports C++20.
- **`Scriptable.`** Embed it right into your own programs.
- **`Universal.`** Supports English, espa√±ol, portugu√™s, and T√ºrk√ße.
- **`Integrated.`** Connects with [many native GUI clipboards.](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/wiki/GUI-Clipboard-Compat)
- **`Tiny.`** Mere tens of kilobytes in size.
- **`FOSS.`** 100% free and open-source.

### **Install Manually**

Get the latest release instead by adding `--branch 0.3.2` right after `git clone...`.

cmake --install .
```

For nix users, run `nix build` and copy `clipboard` from `./result/bin` to `~/.local/bin`, and then create a symlink and add `~/.local/bin` to PATH.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard 
cd Clipboard/nix
nix build
cp ./result/bin/clipboard ~/.local/bin/clipboard
ln -s ~/.local/bin/clipboard ~/.local/bin/cb
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### **Uninstall**

Remove all the files in `install_manifest.txt`. If you're not using Windows, you can also do `xargs rm < install_manifest.txt`.

![How To Use](documentation/readme-assets/CBHowToUse.png)

You can substitute `cb` for `clipboard` in all commands. Add a number to the end of the action to choose which clipboard you want to use (the default is 0), or `_` to use a persistent clipboard. 

---

**Copy** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]copy|[-]cp)[(num)|_(id)] (file) [files]` or `(something) | clipboard [([--]copy|[-]cp)][(num)|_(id)]`

---


**Cut** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]cut|[-]ct)[(num)|_(id)] (file) [files]`

---

**Paste** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]paste|[-]p)[(num)|_(id)]` or `clipboard [([--]paste|[-]p][(num)|_(id)] | (something)` or `clipboard [([--]paste|[-]p)][(num)|_(id)] > (some file)`

---

**Add Contents** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]add|[-]ad)[(num)|_(id)] (file|text) [files]` or `(something) | clipboard [([--]add|[-]ad)][(num)|_(id)]`

---

**Show Contents** &emsp; `clipboard ([--]show|[-]sh)[(num)|_(id)]`

---

---

**`CLIPBOARD_ALWAYS_PERSIST`** &emsp; Set this to anything to make Clipboard always use persistent clipboards.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_NOGUI`** &emsp; Set this to anything to disable integration with GUI clipboards.

---

**`CLIPBOARD_SILENT`** &emsp; Set this to anything to disable progress and confirmation messages from Clipboard.
