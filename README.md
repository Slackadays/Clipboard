üçπüòé Clipboard makes your life <ins>easy</ins>. üèñÔ∏èüå¥
</h1>

To copy or move a unique filesystem object or data stream requires a proper representation of the source and target locations of the two objects involved such that the source exists and the target is available to be written to.

Yuck! Pretend that never happened.

Clipboard _is <ins>the</ins> time and effort saver_ to use **anywhere in the terminal** to cut, copy, and paste (and more) with, just how you would on a desktop! It's like having a helper with a perfect memory by your side. You'll be sitting on a sunny beach sipping a papaya smoothie with the love of your life in no time. Ok, so maybe that last part won't actually happen, but you get the idea.

<details><summary><h3>Why use Clipboard</h3></summary>

- **Cut, copy, or paste files, directories, text, data, or any other kind of information.**
- **Add, remove, or make note of whatever you hold with Clipboard.**
- **Store everything in an infinite number of different containers at your disposal.**
- **Choose if your containers are temporary or totally persistent.**
- **Connect right with your regular desktop [which Clipboard probably supports.](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard/wiki/GUI-Clipboard-Compat)**
- **Do all of this in style with Clipboard's exquisite design.**
- **Speak espa√±ol, portugu√™s, or T√ºrk√ße? You're in luck because Clipboard's in these languages too.**
- **Love freedom? We've got your back because Clipboard's 100% free and open source under the GPLv3.**

### Premade Builds

<a href="https://repology.org/project/clipboard/versions"><img src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/clipboard.svg" alt="Packaging status"></a>

You can also download Clipboard [directly from GitHub Actions.](https://nightly.link/Slackadays/Clipboard/workflows/main/main)

---

### Install Manually (you'll need CMake and C++20 support)
Get the latest release instead by adding `--branch 0.4.0` right after `git clone...`.
Change the system installation prefix by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/custom/prefix` to `cmake ..`.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard 
cd Clipboard/build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel ..
cmake --build .
cmake --install .
```

### Uninstall

Remove all the files in `install_manifest.txt`. If you're not using Windows, you can also do `xargs rm < install_manifest.txt`.

![How To Use](documentation/readme-assets/CBHowToUse.png)

You can substitute `cb` for `clipboard` in all commands. Add a number to the end of the action to choose which clipboard you want to use (the default is 0), or `_` to use a persistent clipboard. 

### Examples

```
clipboard copy contacts/JohnSmith NuclearLaunchCodes.pdf
clipboard cut69 MyDirectory
cb cp420 bar.conf NotAVirus.pdf.mp3.exe baz.txt
cb show420
cb add69 SomeFile
clipboard clr
```
