# Pull Request Requirements

We're always accepting pull requests for contributions to Clipboard. 

To keep Clipboard's quality high and the PRs flowing smoothly, we have three very simple rules that all PRs must follow.

### Use Clipboard's Existing Code Style

All code PRs must follow a similar code style to that of the existing code in Clipboard, unless the PR is about the code style itself.

### All Tests Must Pass

This might seem obvious, but all PRs must pass all the automated tests that we've set up to ensure a quality experience, unless the PR is about the tests themselves.

### Must Be Feature-Complete

All PRs must be "feature complete." This means that you can't replace a feature with a TODO or remove it altogether, unless the PR is all about mofifying that feature.

# Thanks for your contributions! 👋
